=====================================
OK, I spent a fair bit of time today write the script + template
files so that I can automate the production of the uucp systems.
I'll upload this all to Github and add instructions there.

Tuesday 7 March  21:02:45 AEST 2017
===================================
I just created a uunet and I've set things up so that:

munnari (calls) ===> seismo (calls) ===> uunet

with uucp and sendmail configs so that each knows who they are directly
connected to. I can do this:

munnari# echo hello | mail seismo\!uunet\!root

and the e-mail turns up on uunet. I can also reply to this e-mail and it
returns back to munnari. I'm very happy!

The next things to do are:
- make the disk image smaller so I can have more of them
- write a topology table and a script that generates a system-specific
  .dsk and .ini file, so that I can run them all and send e-mail from
  anywhere to anywhere.

Tuesday 7 March  20:16:44 AEST 2017
===================================
I changed munnari.oz to munnari in /etc/rc.local and in the uucp/sendmail
config, and now I can reply to e-mails from munnari.

Files In/Out of a System
------------------------
On the Linux side: $ bsdtar cf - [files] | mktape /dev/stdin > munnari.tap
On the BSD side:
$ ctrl-E
sim> det ts
sim> att ts munnari.tap
sim > c
munnari# mt rew
munnari# tar vtf /dev/rmt12


Tuesday 7 March  19:01:45 AEST 2017
===================================
mail now sort of works. On seismo, I had to put in an L.sys entry
to describe munnari:
munnari Never DIR 9600 tty00 "" "" ogin:--ogin:--ogin: uucp ssword: uucp

I had to run make mkdirs (see RCS/mkdirs) to make the right uucp dirs on
each system.

Then sendmail. I used cad.mc, edited the top to say, e.g.
# internet hostname
Cwseismo

# UUCP name
DUseismo
CUseismo

# UUCP hosts that we talk to
CWmunnari

(and the reverse for munnari), and made cad.cf, then changed to sendmail.cf
and copied the two cf files over to the systems.

Tuesday 7 March  16:51:51 AEST 2017 - wkt
=========================================
uucp now works. Run
$ vax780 seismo.ini		in one window and
$ vax780 munnari.ini		in another window

Both systems have root with no password. On munnari, I have in L-devices:
DIR tty00 unused 9600 direct

and in L.sys:
seismo Any;9 DIR 9600 tty00 "" "" ogin:--ogin:--ogin: uucp ssword: uucp

and in /etc/ttys:
08tty00

The SimH configs for the two devices are:
# (munnari) Set up eight DZ serial ports in 8-bit mode.
# Connect line 0 to localhost port 8888.
# Connect the remaining lines to listen on port 8890.
set dz lines=8
set dz 8b
attach dz line=0,Connect=localhost:8888
att dz -m 8890

# (seismo) Set up eight DZ serial ports in 8-bit mode.
# Connect all lines to listen on port 8888.
set dz lines=8
set dz 8b
att dz -m 8888

As root on munnari, I can do:
# /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sseismo -x7

and I see this conversation

munnari.oz# /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sseismo -x7

That's as far as I've got. 4.2BSD runs sendmail, and I haven't worked out
how to configure sendmail yet. I tried to uucp but that didn't work, so
there is more to do.

Tuesday 7 March  08:07:21 AEST 2017
===================================
I now have two 4.2 images, seismo and munnari. I can boot both, and tip
from munnari to seismo. Now I need to work out how to do uucp!

Mon Mar  6 20:40:53 AEST 2017
=============================
As per gunkies:
http://gunkies.org/wiki/Installing_4.2_BSD_on_SIMH
But I can't get the CPU to idle.

Here is how to set /dev/tty00 to connect out to another system:
attach dz Line=0,Connect=localhost:8888

I used this to connect to myself (same 4.3BSD system) using tip. I
had to edit /etc/ttys and disable getty on /dev/tty00. The I had to edit
/etc/remote and set dialer up to be /dev/tty00 at speed 9600.

We can also set aside two lines, but keep the other six for incoming logins:
# Set up eight DZ serial ports in 7-bit mode.
# Connect line 0 to line 1 on port 8889.
# Connect the remaining lines on port 8888.
set dz lines=8
set dz 7b
att dz -m line=1,8889
attach dz line=0,Connect=localhost:8889
att dz -m 8888
